<p>Bhagat Singh, (born September 28, 1907, Lyallpur, western Punjab, India [now in Pakistan]—died March 23, 1931,<br>
Lahore [now in Pakistan]), revolutionary hero of the Indian independence movement.</p>
<p>Bhagat Singh attended Dayanand Anglo Vedic High School, which was operated by Arya Samaj (a reform sect of modern Hinduism),<br> 
and then National College, both located in Lahore. He began to protest British rule in India while still a youth and soon fought <br>
for national independence. He also worked as a writer and editor in Amritsar for Punjabi- and Urdu-language newspapers espousing <br>
Marxist theories.He is credited with popularizing the catchphrase “Inquilab zindabad” (“Long live the revolution”). </p>

<p>In 1928 Bhagat Singh plotted with others to kill the police chief responsible for the death of Indian writer and politician <br>
Lala Lajpat Rai, one of the founders of National College, during a silent march opposing the Simon Commission. Instead, in a case of <br>
mistaken identity, junior officer J.P. Saunders was killed, and Bhagat Singh had to flee Lahore to escape the death penalty. <br>
In 1929 he and an associate lobbed a bomb at the Central Legislative Assembly in Delhi to protest the implementation of the Defence of<br>
India Act and then surrendered. He was hanged at the age of 23 for the murder of Saunders. </p>
